# Mutation-analysis
This is intended to fill out data that was mined from the dmd.nl database on Muscular Dystrophy with relevant physical characteristics and assess any trends in physical characteristics and the likelihood of being a disease causing mutation.


The data was mined from the dmd.nl database with necessary permissions.
Then data concerning physical characteristics such as amino acid size, polarity, acidity/basicity are all added into the table.
Also model predictions of the heat capacity are included.
Exploratory analysis through pariwise graphing and correlation are all followed by significance testing through ANOVA and t-tests
comparing disease causing and non-disease causing mutations to inform studies on the Dystrophin protein for Biophysical purposes.


# Ultimately, this analysis conveyed a significant difference in the predicted change in heat capacity between disease causing 
and non-disease causing mutations that informed our lab to use Differential Scanning calorimetry to study this protein 
as it is the only method that can detect a change in heat capacity directly.
